# ripalot

ripalot is a tool for people who need to _rip a lot_ of audio CDs. Since it is written in Python,
its name can also be considered an homage to the musical Spamalot (which the developer has never
seen and has no particular interest in seeing, but he thought it was worth acknowledging anyway).

It's FreeBSD only for now due to the use of OS-specific commands for interfacing with optical
drives. Linux support may or may not be added in the future.
